# Evolutionary Paths of Data Ecosystems — Three-paper proposal
Version: 2026-02-18

This document critically reviews the project notes and proposes how to split the topic into three tightly related Information Systems papers. Each paper includes RQs, contribution claims, theoretical lenses, high-level methods, and an S–C–R (Situation–Complication–Resolution) style introduction.

**Critical review (brief)**
- **Strengths:** Clear phenomenon (decentralized data ecosystems, DDEs); practical anchors (Catena-X, IDSA, SCSN); useful initial building blocks (value capture asymmetry, use-case centric argument, flywheel). Strong managerial relevance and potential for top-tier IS outlets.
- **Gaps / risks:** Vague operationalization of key constructs ("value capture", "sustainability", "capabilities"); limited discussion of measurement and counterfactuals; selection and survivorship bias risk when choosing successful cases; causal claims (flywheel → scaling) need stronger longitudinal and comparative evidence.
- **Recommendations:** 1) Tighten definitions and candidate measures early. 2) Sequence papers so comparative evolutionary patterns come first (observational), design prescriptions second (mechanism and process), and capability measurement and validation third (generalization, instruments). 3) Use mixed methods: archival timelines + process tracing + interviews + survey for scaling.

**Paper 1 — Evolutionary Paths of (Decentralized) Data Ecosystems**
- Title (suggested): "From Pilots to Platforms: Evolutionary Paths and Archetypes of Decentralized Data Ecosystems"
- Core RQ: What archetypal evolutionary paths do decentralized data ecosystems follow from inception to (attempted) scale, and which contextual conditions shape those paths?
- Contribution: (a) Taxonomy of evolutionary archetypes (e.g., "Use‑case first", "Anchor‑firm led", "Platform capture", "Public subsidy"), (b) multi‑dimensional phase model (foundation → use‑case validation → capability codification → scaling), and (c) propositions linking archetypes to sustainability outcomes.
- Theoretical lenses: Ecosystem emergence and lifecycle theory, transaction cost economics (TCE), diffusion/critical mass literature, viable system model (VSM) and organizational theory.
- Methods / data: Comparative longitudinal case studies (Catena‑X, SCSN, selected IDSA initiatives); archival traces (repos, governance docs, membership fees/timelines), semi‑structured interviews with ecosystem managers, and timeline coding into the proposed "swimlane" framework.
- Suggested structure (sections): Introduction & RQ, Theory & related work, Conceptual evolutionary framework, Methods, Comparative cases and coded swimlanes, Archetypes & propositions, Discussion & implications.
- S–C–R intro (one para):
  Situation: Industry actors and policy bodies are investing in decentralized data ecosystems to unlock inter‑organizational data value.  
  Complication: Many DDEs remain pilots or stagnate because costs, governance burdens, and asymmetric value capture deter broad participation.  
  Resolution: We develop an empirically grounded evolutionary framework and typology of archetypes that explains how different early choices (foundation investments, use‑case focus, anchor actors) lead to diverging scaling outcomes, and derive testable propositions for when ecosystems are likely to scale.

**Paper 2 — Towards Sustainable, Use‑Case‑Centric Data Ecosystems**
- Title (suggested): "Use‑Case‑Centric Design for Sustainable Data Ecosystems: A Process Model and Playbook"
- Core RQ: How can a use‑case centric development path be operationalized so that small and peripheral ecosystem participants achieve non‑negative net benefits within a reasonable timeframe?
- Contribution: (a) A prescriptive, iterative process model (Sense → Seize → Transform → Operate & Learn) with operational artifacts (playbooks, prioritization heuristics, subsidy/subvention mechanisms), (b) boundary conditions and design principles for sustainable participation, and (c) practical tooling (templates for MVP use cases and cost‑sharing options).
- Theoretical lenses: Transaction cost economics, collective action and public goods, resource dependence, and applied dynamic capabilities (as a design lens). Link to Paper 1 archetypes (which design choices map to which archetype).
- Methods / data: Embedded comparative process tracing in 2–3 focal ecosystems (one successful/near‑sustainable, one stalled, one anchor‑driven), cost‑benefit sketches for representative actors (OEM, tier‑n supplier), and practitioner co‑design workshops to refine playbooks.
- Suggested structure: Theory + normative model, Iterative model and artifacts, Case demonstrations and playbook examples, Evaluation (feasibility, transferability), Managerial guidance.
- S–C–R intro (one para):
  Situation: DDE stakeholders agree that actionable use cases must motivate participation.  
  Complication: Early DDE efforts often recruit participants before proving value; small actors face high fixed and integration costs and uncertain payoffs.  
  Resolution: We offer a use‑case centric iterative development path and a set of operational artifacts (prioritization, cost‑sharing, codification playbooks) that reduce onboarding friction and ensure smaller actors can expect non‑negative returns on participation.

**Paper 3 — Dynamic Capabilities to Create and Capture Value in Data Ecosystems**
- Title (suggested): "Ecosystem Dynamic Capabilities: Creating and Capturing Value in Decentralized Data Networks"
- Core RQ: What dynamic capabilities are necessary at ecosystem and actor levels to create and capture value in DDEs, and how should they be configured for different archetypes?
- Contribution: (a) A capability inventory and measurement model for ecosystem DCs (sensing, seizing, transforming, codifying, governing, operating), (b) empirical validation across cases and a targeted survey instrument, and (c) a diagnostics tool (capability maturity + investment priorities) and the flywheel formalization.
- Theoretical lenses: Dynamic capabilities (Eisenhardt & Martin), resource‑based view (VRIN/RBV), multi‑firm governance, and VSM for systemic properties.
- Methods / data: Develop and validate a survey instrument with ecosystem participants (quantitative testing of H1–H4), augment with qualitative process evidence from Paper 1/2 cases, and use regression/PLS or qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to link capabilities to outcomes (use‑case delivery rate, participant retention, perceived fairness of value capture).
- Suggested structure: Theory & capability taxonomy, Instrument development, Empirical validation & statistics, Maturity model and manager toolkit, Discussion.
- S–C–R intro (one para):
  Situation: Scholars and practitioners recognize that capabilities determine whether data availability translates into economic value.  
  Complication: DC theory is typically firm‑centric; applying it to multi‑actor ecosystems raises measurement, attribution, and coordination problems.  
  Resolution: We define ecosystem‑level dynamic capabilities, operationalize them for measurement, and validate their linkage to ecosystem performance, providing a practical diagnostics and prioritization tool for ecosystem designers.

**Operationalization: measures and candidate indicators**
- Value capture (per actor): net benefit over 24–36 months (costs: integration, membership, compliance; benefits: saved costs, new revenue, risk mitigation). Use proxies where needed (self‑reported ROI bands, adoption of data products, changes in process KPIs).  
- Use‑case success: delivery time, realized KPI improvement, number of adopters.  
- Capability reuse: count of artifacts reused (APIs, templates, certification instances).  
- Governance maturity: presence of clear membership rules, fees, liability rules, data contracts.

**Candidate data sources & contacts**
- Public archives and code/data repos (IDSA resources, Catena‑X public documentation, SCSN materials).  
- Governance docs, membership lists, meeting minutes, funding schedules.  
- Semi‑structured interviews: platform/anchor firm leads, SME suppliers, neutral service providers (T‑systems), regulatory stakeholders.  
- Quantitative survey to ecosystem participants (designed in Paper 3).

**Sequence and dependencies (recommended)**
- Paper 1 (comparative evolutionary analysis) → Paper 2 (design & playbook; uses Paper 1 archetypes as boundary conditions) → Paper 3 (capability measurement and generalization).  
- Rationale: Paper 1 builds causal/temporal descriptive grounding; Paper 2 translates into prescriptive interventions; Paper 3 generalizes and validates mechanisms quantitatively.

**Next steps (practical)**
1. Finalize construct definitions and candidate measures (value capture, sustainability, capability reuse).  
2. Identify 4–6 ecosystems for Paper 1 (mix of anchor‑led, public, private, and stalled cases).  
3. Draft interview guide and archival coding scheme (swimlane template).  
4. Run initial archival timeline coding for 2 quick cases (15–20 hours) to validate swimlane framework.  
5. Prepare survey draft linked to the capability inventory for Paper 3.
